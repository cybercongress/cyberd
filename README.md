# Cyber - Knowledge consensus computer for The Great Web

## Vision

Google is the most powerful religion ever, and now is the time to abandon it. The Great Web is coming. A search system that will drive its growth, needs to be censorless, open and relevant. 

## Cyber as a computer 

Cyber is a knowledge consensus computer for answers and a search engine. Cyber is defined by web3 agents. It is a distributed consensus supercomputer that runs on top of IPFS. It can compute relevance for web3 data via the use of cyberlinks.

## Cyber Protocol
In its core the protocol is very minimalistic and can be expressed by the following steps:
- Compute the genesis of cyber protocol based on the distribution games
- Define the state of the knowledge graph
- Gather transactions, using consensus computer
- Check the validity of the signatures
- Check the bandwidth limit
- Check the validity of CIDv0/CIDv1
- If the signatures, the bandwidth limit and CIDv1 are all valid - apply cyberlinks and transactions
- Calculate cyber~rank values every round for the CIDs on the knowledge graph
