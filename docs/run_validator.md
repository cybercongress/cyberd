# Join Cyberd Network As Validator

**Note**. Currently active dev testnet is `euler-dev3` (substitute <testnet_chain_id> with that value).

## Prepare your server

First, you have to setup a server. 
You are supposed to run your validator node all time, so you will need a reliable server to keep it running. 
Also, you may consider to use any cloud services like AWS or DigitalOcean.

Cyberd is based on Cosmos SDK written in Go. 
It should work on any platform which can compile and run programs in Go. 
However, I strongly recommend running the validator node on a Linux server.

Here is the current required server specification to run validator node:

1. No. of CPUs: 6
2. RAM: 32GB
3. Card with Nvidia CUDA support(ex 1080ti) and at least 8gb VRAM.
4. Disk: 256GB SSD


## Install Dependencies

Our main distribution unit is docker container. 
All images are located in default [Dockerhub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/cyberd/cyberd/).
Docker installation instruction can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
In order to access **GPU** from container, nvidia drivers version **410+** and 
 [nvidia docker runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) should be installed on host system.

**Note**: Before installing nvidia docker runtime, reboot pc(nvidia drivers should be loaded into kernel during startup),
 check that drivers loaded correctly by `nvidia-smi` command.
  
Check both driver and docker runtime installed correctly:
```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda:10.0-base nvidia-smi

## Start Fullnode 

First, create folder, where daemon and cli will store data. Some commands may require admin privileges.
```bash
mkdir /cyberd
```

Run daemon with mounted volumes on created during previous step folder.
```bash
docker run -d --name=cyberd --restart always --runtime=nvidia \
 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 26660:26660 \
 -v /cyberd/daemon:/root/.cyberd \
 -v /cyberd/cli:/root/.cyberdcli \
 cyberd/cyberd:<testnet_chain_id>
```

To check if your node is connected to the testnet, you can run this:
```
docker exec cyberd cyberdcli status
```
You should be seeing a returned JSON with your node status including node_info, sync_info and validator_info.

## Prepare stake address

Alright, you are now connected to the testnet. 
To be a validator, you will need some **CBD**(cyberd coin) to be bounded as your stake. 
Top 146 validators by bounded stake will be active validators taking part in consensus. 

If you already have address with **CBD**, just restore it with your seed phrase into your local keystore.
```bash
docker exec -ti cyberd cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> --recover
docker exec cyberd cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

If no, create new one using command below. 
Also, you should send coins to that address to bound them later during validator submitting. 
```
docker exec -ti cyberd cyberdcli keys add <your_key_name> 
docker exec cyberd cyberdcli keys show <your_key_name>
```

**<your_key_name>** is any name you pick to represent this key pair. 
You have to refer to this <your_key_name> later when you use the keys to sign transactions. 
It will ask you to enter your password twice to encrypt the key. 
You also need to enter your password when you use your key to sign any transaction.

The command returns the address, public key and a seed phrase which you can use it to 
recover your account if you forget your password later.
Keep the seed phrase in a safe place in case you have to use them.

The address showing here is your account address. Let’s call this **<your_account_address>**. 
It stores your assets.


## Send create validator transaction

Validators are actors on the network committing new blocks by submitting their votes. 
It refers to the node itself, not a single person or a single account.
Therefore, the public key here is referring to the node public key, 
not the public key of the address you have just created.

To get the node public key, run the following command.

```bash
docker exec cyberd cyberd tendermint show-validator
```

It will return a bech32 public key. Let’s call it **<your_node_pubkey>**.
The next step you have to declare a validator candidate. 
The validator candidate is the account which stake the coins. 
So the validator candidate is an account this time.
To declare a validator candidate, run the following command adjusting stake amount and other fields.

```bash
docker exec -ti cyberd cyberdcli tx stake create-validator \
  --amount=100CBD \
  --pubkey=<your_node_pubkey> \
  --moniker=<your_node_nickname> \
  --trust-node \
  --from=<your_key_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --chain-id=<testnet_chain_id>
```
