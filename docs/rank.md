### Calculate rank in parallel (once at 600 blocks)

1. Down during calculation -> need to restart with rank calculation with old context
2. Need to hold and show to users all new links

We need at least two contexts.â€¨ First, context with current rank graph.
It should be updated every 600 blocks from the second context.
Second, context only with new links that comes during 600 blocks calculation.

In block `n: (n % 600 == 0)` we should have calculation results somewhere 
(so may be we even don't need to synchronize calculation goroutine except cases of failure)
and come up with new rank hash.
Also we should update main rank storage with all new links.

Problems:

1. What if validator node falls and after restart it has not enough time to recalculate rank
 (cause it need to start calculation from scratch).
2. We cannot predict block where calculation will be finished.
Need to hold calculation results till block `n: (n % 600 == 0)`?
Also we could fall while holding calculation results.
May be we need third context...

Don't save rank. Calculate it before node start.
If node falls then it should recalculate rank.
Node doesn't participate in consensus till rank not calculated (obvious).

We probably don't care about indices of new cids and user stakes cause they are ordered by numbers
and in rank calculation algorithm no needed numbers will be ignored (need to check).

We could store cidCount per rank calculation.

#### New links handling

Add new incoming links cids to index with rank 0 (only for new cids), so they immediately can be seen by users.
Include those "zero" ranks to consensus hash.

Problems:
1. Reload of app state after failure (dealing with hashes).
 Store 3 hashes (last calculation hash, last block hash, new calculation hash)
2. Recalculation of index. New links will go to next rank calculation and old index (with those links) 
will be replaced by currently calculated rank.

For building index we need to find sorting algorithm that will be fast on almost sorted arrays. 
Also we should implement it for GPU (therefore it better be parallelizable). Mergesort(Timsort), Heapsort, Smoothsort???
